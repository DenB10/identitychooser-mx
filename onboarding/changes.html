          <h1>Identity Chooser</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to version 4 of Identity Chooser.
          </p>

          <p>
            Identity Chooser has been going through a lot of changes
            over the years and this new version is no different. While
            the new update comes with slight changes to your workflow,
            these changes also cover more use cases.
          </p>

          <p>
            This version is implemented as a pure MailExtension. While
            this technology doesn't support the same level of
            customization users are used to, it does promise greater
            stability and longterm support for Thunderbird and
            addons.
          </p>

            <h2>What's new?</h2>
            <p>
              Previous versions of Identity Chooser modified parts of
              Thunderbird's user interface directly by adding a menu
              with your identities/mail addresses to compose, reply
              and forward buttons. This is not possible anymore
              with MailExtensions. Instead, theses buttons remain
              unchanged and you can choose your sender address
              directly in the new message compose window --
              immediately after the window opened.
            </p>

            <p>
              This new workflow has the advantage that it works every
              time and everywhere Thunderbird opens a new
              message. This means, Identity Chooser doesn't only work
              in the main window; it also is active when you create a
              new email directly out of the address book, for
              instance.
            </p>

          <h2>Thank you!</h2>
          <p>
            I've been working on Identity Chooser since 2010, making
            changes and improvements. I couldn't have done it without
            your support.
          </p>
