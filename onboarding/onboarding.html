      <h1>Identity Chooser</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to version 4 of Identity Chooser.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you remember the first time you accidentally sent a work
        related email from your private email account?  Identity
        Chooser helps you to prevent that. It makes choosing the
        sender address explicit:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Do you want to compose a new email? Identity Chooser forces you to choose the sender address first.</li>

        <li>Do you want to forward an email? Identity Chooser forces you to choose the sender address first.</li>

        <li>To make it short: Every time you'll create a new message, Identity Chooser shows you a menu with all your identities.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Everything in Identity Chooser is about making explicit choices. No automatisms, no defaults.</p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          Whenever you open an email editor -- be it to write a new
          email, reply to one or forward it -- Identity Chooser will
          open a window to force you to choose your sender address
          before it let's you access the email editor.
        </p>

        <p>
          This new workflow has the advantage that it works every time
          and everywhere Thunderbird opens a new message. This means,
          Identity Chooser doesn't only work in the main window; it
          also is active when you create a new email directly out of
          the address book, for instance.

        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>
          Identity Chooser is very configurable:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>It let's you decide when it is active (write, reply and/or forward),</li>
          <li>It allows you to hide emails, and</li>
          <li>It let's you rearrange the order of your email adresses</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you want to show a colorful border around the "+ New
          Message" window, so you can tell different identities
          apart, I recommend the
          addon <a href='https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/bordercolors-d/'>Border
            Colors D</a>. Identity Chooser detects an installed copy
          of Border Colors D and integrates with it intelligently.

      <h2>Thank you!</h2>
      <p>
        I've been working on Identity Chooser since 2010, making
        changes and improvements. I couldn't have done it without
        your support.
